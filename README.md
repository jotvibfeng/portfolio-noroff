# Portfolio-noroff
This is the final project of the first year with the front-end study at Noroff. Here we made the first portfolio so that we could practice are skills we have got to prepare ourselves for looking for a job.

# What is the project purpose
To introduce us to ourselves what projects we have made what skills we have for our future employer. The process of making this portfolio was not easy at the beginning having failed at my first attempt and having no inspiration on how to do the project was not very good. I was lost and not sure what I should then I came on that my sister who is a UX designer could give me some advice on how I should make a portfolio. After had talked to her I had a bit more clue about how I should do this now and am happy of what I have done now compared to what I sent on my first attempt.
